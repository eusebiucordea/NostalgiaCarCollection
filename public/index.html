            <b>"Out of a passion for cars, our family has collected vehicles manufactured since 1899. We now have the pleasure of sharing this passion with the visitors of the gallery. A part of the history of automotive evolution is found in this collection," said a member of the Nostalgia Family at the launch event in 2013.</b>
            <br><br>
            The Nostalgia Family, known for their love of sports and dedication to promoting Romanian culture both at home and abroad, have a rich history intertwined with physical education and sports. Many family members have graduated from the Institute of Physical Culture in Bucharest (now the National Academy of Physical Education and Sport) with the title of professor of physical education and sport, specializing in various disciplines including tennis and basketball.
            <br><br>
            Between 1958 and 1964, one family member distinguished themselves as a professional hockey player for the Stiinta Bucharest club, participating with the national team in the Ice Hockey World Championships and representing Romania at the Winter Olympics in Innsbruck in 1964.
            <br><br>
            In parallel, between 1957 and 1972, another family member was active as a tennis player for Steagul Rosu Brasov and Dinamo Bucharest, winning over 40 titles, including the doubles at Roland Garros. The family has collectively participated in more than 150 Davis Cup matches for Romania, including 3 finals against the United States. As a result of their sports performances, the family has received numerous accolades, including the title of "Emeritus Master of Sport."
            <br><br>
            The Nostalgia Car Collection Gallery was inaugurated in November 2013 and currently occupies an area of approximately 4,300 square meters, located opposite Henri Coanda Airport in Otopeni. Visitors can find models from the most important car manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz, Rolls-Royce, Cadillac, Ferrari, Aston Martin, Lamborghini, Ford, Dodge, Harley Davidson, and Porsche.
            <br><br>
            The gallery is the only current collection in the world that holds all 7 models of the Rolls Royce Phantom series I-VII, including 2 units from the fourth series, the most exclusive Rolls Royce generation ever built. Only 18 such vehicles were produced between 1950 and 1956 and were initially intended for royal families and heads of state.
            <br><br>
            One of the rarest exhibits in the collection is a DeLorean DMC-12, renowned for its iconic design and gull-wing doors. Manufactured in the early 1980s, the DeLorean is a rare find with only about 9,000 units ever produced, making it a prized possession for car enthusiasts and collectors.
            <br><br>
            All the exhibits in the Nostalgia Car Collection gallery are functional, maintained by a dedicated team of mechanics, with many of the gallery's exhibits being completely restored in their own workshop.
